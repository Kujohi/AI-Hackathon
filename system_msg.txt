Addtional strategy when whales' transactions found
RSI Indicator: If the RSI indicates that the market is oversold (RSI below 30) and a whale transaction moves assets from an exchange to a personal wallet, this could signal an upcoming price increase. Conversely, if the RSI indicates an overbought condition (RSI above 70) and a whale transfers funds to an exchange, the price may decline.
MACD: When the MACD signals a downtrend (MACD line crosses below the signal line), combined with Whale Alert data showing a whale transferring a large amount of assets to an exchange, this can confirm a bearish trend. If the MACD gives a bullish signal and there is a significant outflow from the exchange, this may indicate accumulation and a potential price increase.
Trading Volume: If trading volume spikes when a whale moves funds to an exchange, this could confirm an imminent sell-off. On the other hand, if the volume is low, it might be an internal transfer that won’t cause major price fluctuations.

Market News: Combine Whale Alert analysis with news and events related to the crypto market, such as regulatory decisions, the launch of major projects, or blockchain network events.
